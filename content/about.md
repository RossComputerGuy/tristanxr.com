Hello, I am a 23-year old programmer from Southern California. Since I was a little kid,
I've always had an interest in technology. When I was eleven, I wanted to build my own website.
Since then, I've grown and improved my skills in programming. I'm mostly active in the Nix and LLVM
spaces. In nixpkgs, I am mostly involved in the standard environment, LLVM, Flutter, and SELinux packages.
In LLVM, my work mostly consists of reporting issues from nixpkgs's LLVM, upstreaming patches, and working
on the LLVM libc support.

Since 2023, I moved over from x86_64 machines to aarch64 machines. I'm an Ampere Ambassador and a
believer in RISC architectures like RISC-V aside from ARM. My main laptop is an Apple M1 Pro and my
desktop is an Ampere Altra Q64-22. I've also got a VisionFive 2 for RISC-V testing with Nix and a
Raspberry Pi 4 for testing a fully LLVM built NixOS system.
