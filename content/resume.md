# Experience

## Jr DevOps Engineer - Ezoic

<sub>August 2022 - January 2023</sub>

I had the opportunity to work at Ezoic for about 6 months as a DevOps Engineer.
It was a great opportunity despite it being short lived.
I made great friends and connections along the way.

## Stocker - 88 Ranch Marketplace

<sub>March 2022 - August 2022</sub>

After moving to California, I switched to an Asian market called 88 Ranch.
It has allowed me to learn about how stores put out products.
Another ability I have learned is front facing, a technique used to ensure more
product is sold and a method of organization. 

## Cashier - Chipotle

<sub>November 2019 - March 2022</sub>

Not my first choice for a place to work at but it was a good experience.
I got to meet many new people and some who have become my friends.
